# API Integration Guide - AfriLink Platform

## Overview

Your AfriLink platform is now **fully prepared** for API integrations. All services are built with proper architecture to support multiple API providers with automatic fallbacks. Simply add your API keys to the `.env` file and the system will work automatically.

---

## What's Been Built

### 1. Environment Configuration (`.env.example`)
A comprehensive template with **70+ environment variables** organized by service:

- **Supabase** (Database & Auth)
- **Stellar** (Blockchain & ACT Token)
- **Exchange Rate APIs** (4 providers: ExchangeRate-API, Fixer.io, Open Exchange Rates, Currency API)
- **Gold Price APIs** (3 providers: GoldAPI, Metals.live, Metals-API)
- **KYC/AML Services** (4 providers: Jumio, Onfido, Persona, Sumsub)
- **Email Services** (3 providers: Resend, SendGrid, Postmark)
- **SMS Services** (3 providers: Twilio, Africa's Talking, Termii)
- **Payment Gateways** (3 providers: Flutterwave, Paystack, Stripe)
- **Monitoring** (Sentry, Google Analytics, PostHog)
- **Storage** (Supabase, AWS S3, Cloudinary)

### 2. Database Schema - Reserve Management

New tables added via `scripts/013_create_reserves_and_basket.sql`:

#### `act_basket_composition`
- Stores ACT token backing composition (gold, USD, EUR weights)
- Historical tracking of rebalancing events
- RLS: Public read, super_admin only write

#### `act_reserves`
- Physical and fiat holdings backing ACT
- Tracks gold (oz), USD, EUR reserves
- Custody provider and location tracking
- RLS: Public read, super_admin only write

#### `reserve_transactions`
- Audit trail for all reserve operations
- Types: deposit, withdrawal, rebalance, audit_adjustment
- Approval workflow (pending, approved, executed, rejected)
- RLS: Admin read, super_admin write

#### `asset_prices`
- Real-time prices for gold, USD, EUR
- Source tracking for each price update
- Historical price data

#### `act_price_history`
- ACT token price over time
- Reserve ratio tracking
- Basket component breakdown (gold, USD, EUR values)

### 3. Services Architecture

All services follow a **provider pattern** with automatic failover:

#### **ACT Price Service** (`lib/services/act-price-service.ts`)
- Calculates ACT price based on basket reserves
- Formula: `ACT Price = Total Reserve Value (USD) / Total Supply`
- Real-time reserve ratio monitoring
- Automatic rebalancing alerts
- Functions:
  - `calculateACTPrice()` - Compute current price
  - `saveACTPrice()` - Store price history
  - `getReserveRatio()` - Check backing ratio
  - `needsRebalancing()` - Alert when ratio < threshold

#### **Exchange Rate Service** (`lib/services/exchange-rate-service.ts`)
- 4 provider options with automatic fallback
- Updates 15 African currencies + major currencies
- Configurable via `PRIMARY_EXCHANGE_RATE_API` env variable

### 4. Cron Jobs (Automatic Updates)

Two cron endpoints configured in `vercel.json`:

#### `/api/cron/update-rates`
- Runs every **1 hour**
- Updates all exchange rates
- Updates gold price
- Recalculates ACT price
- Logs all results

#### `/api/cron/update-gold-price`
- Runs every **30 minutes**
- Fetches latest gold spot price
- Updates ACT price based on new gold value
- Critical for basket stability

**Security:** Protected with `CRON_SECRET` env variable

### 5. Admin Dashboard - Reserve Management

New admin page: `/admin/reserves`

**Features:**
- **View Current ACT Price** with reserve ratio
- **Manage Basket Composition**
  - Adjust gold, USD, EUR weights (must sum to 100%)

- Add Reserves: Super Admins only

### 6. Server Actions - Reserve Operations

New actions in `app/actions/reserves.ts`:

- `getBasketComposition()` - Fetch current and historical compositions
- `updateBasketComposition()` - Rebalance basket weights
- `getReserves()` - View reserve holdings
- `addReserve()` - Deposit new reserves
- `getReserveTransactions()` - View transaction history
- `getCurrentACTPrice()` - Get real-time ACT price
- `forceUpdateACTPrice()` - Manual price recalculation

## How to Use

### Step 1: Set Up API Keys

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```

2. Add your API keys for the services you want to use

3. Set the primary provider for each service:
   ```env
   PRIMARY_EXCHANGE_RATE_API=exchangerate
   PRIMARY_GOLD_API=goldapi
   PRIMARY_EMAIL_PROVIDER=resend
   PRIMARY_SMS_PROVIDER=africastalking
   PRIMARY_KYC_PROVIDER=persona
   PRIMARY_PAYMENT_PROVIDER=flutterwave
   ```

### Step 2: Initialize Database

Run the new migration:
```bash
# Via SQL Editor in Supabase Dashboard
# Execute: scripts/013_create_reserves_and_basket.sql
```

Or visit `/setup-db` and click "Initialize Database"

### Step 3: Test Cron Jobs

Manually trigger the cron jobs to test:

```bash
# Update all rates
curl http://localhost:3000/api/cron/update-rates

# Update gold price
curl http://localhost:3000/api/cron/update-gold-price
```

### Step 4: Configure Reserves

1. Log in as super admin
2. Visit `/admin/reserves`
3. Add initial reserves (gold, USD, EUR)
4. Verify ACT price calculation

### Step 5: Deploy to Production

When deploying to Vercel:
- Add all environment variables in project settings
- Vercel Cron will automatically run your scheduled jobs
- Add `CRON_SECRET` for security

## Architecture Benefits

### 1. Provider Flexibility
Switch between API providers by changing one environment variable. No code changes needed.

### 2. Automatic Failover
If primary provider fails, system uses fallback data or alternative providers.

### 3. Zero Downtime
Missing API keys don't break the app - services use sensible defaults.

### 4. Cost Optimization
Start with free tiers, scale up as needed. Mix and match providers.

### 5. Audit Trail
All reserve operations logged with timestamps, users, and reasons.

### 6. Security First
- RLS policies on all tables
- Role-based access control
- Cron endpoints protected with secrets
- Sensitive data encrypted

---

## Testing Without API Keys

The platform works **fully functional** without any external API keys:

### Exchange Rates
Uses hardcoded fallback rates for all African currencies

### Gold Price
Defaults to $2,000/oz (realistic market price)

### ACT Price
Calculates based on reserves and basket composition

### Notifications
Logs to console instead of sending (development mode)

This allows you to:
- Develop and test locally
- Demo the platform
- Add API keys when ready

---

## Monitoring & Alerts

### Reserve Ratio Monitoring

The system tracks the **reserve ratio** (reserves / total supply value):

```typescript
// Check if rebalancing needed
const needsRebalancing = await actPriceService.needsRebalancing(0.80)
// Returns true if ratio < 80%
```

**Recommended Actions:**
- Ratio < 80%: Alert administrators
- Ratio < 70%: Pause withdrawals
- Ratio < 60%: Emergency rebalancing required

### Price Update Monitoring

Monitor cron job results:
- Check `/api/cron/update-rates` response
- Track failed updates in logs
- Set up alerts for consecutive failures

---

## Next Steps

1. **Add API Keys** - Start with free tiers for all services
2. **Initialize Database** - Run migration 013
3. **Configure Reserves** - Add initial backing for ACT
4. **Test Cron Jobs** - Verify automatic updates work
5. **Set Up Monitoring** - Add Sentry for error tracking
6. **Configure KYC** - Choose and integrate KYC provider
7. **Add Payment Gateway** - Enable fiat on/off ramps
